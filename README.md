I am a Computer Engineering graduate student with a research-driven interest in applying technology to
humanitarian outcomes, ethical AI governance, and evidence-based social policy. My work sits at the
intersection of data, human vulnerability, and responsible innovation.

Current focuses
- Humanitarian modelling: poverty, food security, and educational inequality
- AI ethics and governance — bias, accountability, and civic implications
- Research-style notebooks connecting quantitative analysis with social theory

Philosophy
Technology without a moral spine is indistinguishable from harm.  
My work aims to translate computation into decisions that are just, intelligible, and human-protective.

Selected Directions (ongoing & planned)
- County-level poverty analysis with policy narration
- Bias audits of public NLP models on African contexts
- Crisis-communication sentiment modelling
- Narrative and creative computational experiments on displacement and memory

I build in public — not as performance, but as transparent process.
